## WordPress VIP Coding Standards Failure

**PHP Version:** ${{ env.PHP_VERSION }}
**Run ID:** ${{ env.RUN_ID }}
**Workflow:** [View Failed Run](${{ env.WORKFLOW_URL }})

### Issue Description

The WordPress VIP coding standards check has failed during the automated workflow. This scan specifically checks for enterprise-level WordPress development standards required for WordPress VIP platform compatibility.

### VIP Standards Focus Areas

The WordPress VIP Go coding standards check for:

üè¢ **Enterprise Platform Requirements:**
- File system operation restrictions (VIP platform limitations)
- Performance and caching best practices for high-traffic sites
- Security vulnerabilities specific to enterprise WordPress environments
- User experience guidelines for enterprise-level WordPress

üöÄ **Performance & Caching:**
- Uncached function usage patterns
- Database query optimization
- Remote data fetching best practices
- Resource-heavy operation detection

üîí **VIP-Specific Security:**
- File operation security in restricted environments
- Admin bar removal restrictions for VIP support users
- Cookie and caching constraint validations
- Restricted function usage for platform stability

### Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **VIP Standards Context:**
- Many VIP standards are specific to the WordPress VIP hosting platform
- Not all VIP recommendations may apply to standard WordPress installations
- Some restrictions are platform-specific (e.g., file system limitations)
- This scan helps ensure compatibility with enterprise WordPress environments

### Next Steps

1. **Review the workflow logs** to identify specific VIP standard violations
2. **Evaluate applicability** - determine which issues apply to your hosting environment
3. **Prioritize fixes** based on your deployment target:
   - **High Priority:** Security and performance issues
   - **Medium Priority:** General code quality improvements
   - **Low Priority:** VIP platform-specific restrictions (if not targeting VIP)
4. **Update code** to address applicable VIP standard violations
5. **Re-run the workflow** to verify fixes
