# This workflow automatically monitors WordPress version compatibility for the plugin.
# It checks if the "Tested up to" version in readme.txt matches the latest WordPress release.
# The workflow runs weekly and on pushes to main branch to ensure compatibility information
# stays current. When a newer WordPress version is available, it creates an issue or pull request
# to update the compatibility information, helping maintain plugin currency with WordPress releases.
