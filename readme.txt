== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to configure anything? =

The plugin comes with default settings enabled, but you can customize which optimizations to use via the **Settings > Optimizations ACE MC** admin page. Each feature can be individually enabled or disabled.

= What happens if I don't have WooCommerce or WP Store Locator installed? =

The plugin will detect which plugins are available and only show relevant optimization options. Features for missing plugins will be clearly marked as inactive and won't affect your site.

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =

No, this plugin is designed to improve performance by adding useful admin enhancements and optimizations. All features are optional and can be disabled if not needed.

= Is this plugin compatible with other optimization plugins? =
